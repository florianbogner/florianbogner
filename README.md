# Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px">

**I'm Flo from Munich, digital since the Game Boy Color and fascinated by technology of all sorts.**

üë®‚Äçüíª I founded several **IT startups** during and after finishing a B. Sc. in mechanical engineering with a focus on aerospace engineering. Working with the development teams in my companies kindled a passion for software engineering that led me to shift focus from real-world engineering :). Currently, I am responsible for **product management and development of new platforms** at a large personnel service provider. 

üß† Because I am really interested in the intersection of neurology and tech, I am pursuing my **M. Sc. in Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence** at Technical University Munich which I am going to finish in in 2024.

üìö I love reading both novels and scientific literature. In the latter category, the most fascinating reads I can recommend to you are **The Feeling of Life Itself: Why Consciousness Is Widespread but Can't Be Computed** by Christof Koch and **The Book of Why** by Judea Pearl.

üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Apart from reading, my hobbies are **meditating** and learning about buddhist philosophy (check out **Waking Up** by Sam Harris if you are interested), building and flying **model rockets**, meddling with my **Raspberry Pi**, curating my personal playlist of obscure **Dylan** recordings (currently 506 songs long), trying to teach my **dog** cool tricks, **yoga**, **cycling** and playing the **guitar**.
